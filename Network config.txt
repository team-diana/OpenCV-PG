Network configuration: 

Camera should be connected to an ethernet switch and the Tp-Link Access Point with enabled DHCP 
when DHCP is enabled on the network the camera should blink 2 times the green light after the FPGA set orange flash when power on
if blinks 3 or red there is a network issue (router Sitecom DIANA is stupid and sometimes fails, Tplink AP works fine) 
try to launch FlyCap2 to see the camera listing
Ip address assigned is not important because Flycap gets camera info 

BFLY 13E4C-CS is the turret camera 
BFLY 13E4M-CS is the (arm?) camera
